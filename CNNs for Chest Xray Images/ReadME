This is a project about CNNs dedicated for the detection of Pneumonia in Chest Xray Images.
The dataset used is an open-source Kaggle dataset.

This directory contains the final report, the notebooks and the final models.
We implement pre-trained models, which have been trained extensively on large datasets. 
Then we use a custom-designed CNN model with finetuned hyperparameters. 
Finally, we compare the performances of these two models anddiscuss the implications.

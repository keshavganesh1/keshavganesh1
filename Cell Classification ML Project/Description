Introduction

For this machine learning project we were tasked to teach a binary classifier to identify if a given cancer cell could survive in a low oxygen environment 
(i.e. hypoxia) or if the cell needs oxygen to prosper (i.e. normoxia). We used data from an experiment which sequenced RNA from various breast cancer cells. 
Some cells came from a cell line that was in a low oxygen environment (~1%) and the other cells came from a cell line that was exposed to normal levels of 
oxygen. The aim for our binary classifier is to identify which genes (found in the RNA) can be attributed to the ability to survive in a low oxygen environment. 
Intuitively, if a gene were very present in cell from the hypoxia batch and not very present in the normal batch this could possibly mean that this gene helps 
cancer cells to survive even with very limited oxygen. From a medical point of view, this could help determine whether a certain cancer cell would need to be 
near arteries or if it could multiply even without a direct source of oxygen.

Materials and Methods

We were given data derived utilizing Smart-Seq as a sequencing technique. The cell types included in the datasets were MCF7 and HCC1608.
As features, we have various genes what were found when sequencing RNA from the various cells. Later, we moved on to the larger Drop-Seq
dataset.
